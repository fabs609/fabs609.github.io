              <h2>Starborn Fragments</h2>
              <p>
                The Starborn Fragments is a mysterious and ancient wreckage found deep within the asteroid field of the
                Draxos Belt. A lone space explorer, while scavenging for materials to repair their vessel, stumbled upon
                the remains of what appeared to be a once-mighty starship, its metal hull now fractured and scorched.
                The wreckage is a strange amalgamation of materials and technologies, as if several civilizations'
                crafts had been pieced together in an almost desperate attempt to escape something. The core of the ship
                is still somewhat intact, but its central drive engine is completely destroyed, leaving only fragments
                of alien and human components scattered in every direction.




              <p>
                Purpose & Theories: Theories surrounding the wreckage suggest it may have been a multi-species vessel
                caught in a cataclysmic event. Some speculate that it was a ship used for deep-space exploration, or
                perhaps a military vessel caught in a skirmish between two advanced races. Others believe it was part of
                a secret research project, perhaps experimenting with hybrid technology or attempting to create a weapon
                capable of wiping out entire fleets. What is clear is that the wreckage holds the potential for
                unlocking a dark and dangerous history of the galaxy’s forgotten wars and lost collaborations. Many
                fragments of the ship's data banks remain damaged, though some pieces of information hint at a failed
                alliance between multiple species, each contributing to the ship’s design.

              <p>


              </p>

              <p>
                Origins & Discovery: The wreckage was uncovered in 2273 AD by the lone spacer, Captain Thorne Valen, who
                had been navigating the Draxos Belt for salvage. A faint distress signal emanating from the wreckage led
                the captain to it, where the wreckage was partially buried in a dense field of asteroid debris. Initial
                scans revealed the mix of materials, some of which had not been seen before. The precise origins of the
                ship are still unknown, though its hybrid design points to an era of interspecies cooperation or perhaps
                forced cohabitation, as if multiple species had combined their resources to build a vessel capable of
                surviving the most extreme conditions of the galaxy.
              </p>

              <p>
                Material & Features: The wreckage is a confusing patchwork of materials, where human alloys are welded
                to alien metals that show signs of having once been intricately designed, now shattered and jagged.
                Sections of the hull appear scorched, as though it was subjected to an intense battle or catastrophic
                failure. However, some fragments still pulse faintly with energy, suggesting that certain systems might
                be partially functional, or perhaps just unstable. The most intriguing aspect of the wreckage is a
                series of crystalline conduits that seem to run through the hull, much like veins in an organic
                creature, indicating that the ship was once alive with energy and possibly even self-healing
                capabilities. One remaining door mechanism hints at an advanced locking system, seemingly impervious to
                standard human technology. This could be the key to unlocking what lies within the wreckage—if the right
                key is found.
              </p>
